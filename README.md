## Introduction

The **Zomato Data Analysis** project explores customer dining preferences and the factors influencing restaurant ratings and success in India. Using a dataset downloaded from Kaggle with 17 columns and over 50,000 rows, this project aims to identify key trends in online food ordering, popular dining locations, and predict whether a restaurant is expensive based on various factors.

## Key Objectives

- **Customer Preferences**: Analyzing customer dining patterns and preferences.
- **Restaurant Ratings**: Identifying key factors that impact restaurant ratings and success.
- **Location Popularity**: Investigating locations that are popular for online food orders.
- **Cost Prediction**: Using classification models to predict whether a restaurant is expensive.

## Steps Involved

- **Data Preprocessing/Cleaning**: Cleaned and prepared the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring data quality.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted data-driven visualizations to uncover trends, correlations, and patterns in customer preferences and restaurant performance.
  
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new features from the existing dataset to improve model performance.

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzed customer reviews and ratings to understand the sentiment associated with various restaurants.
  
- **Classification Models**: Developed classification models to predict if a restaurant is expensive based on its features and customer reviews.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **IDE**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Libraries**: 
  - Data Preprocessing: `pandas`, `numpy`
  - Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
  - Sentiment Analysis: `nltk`, `textblob`
  - Machine Learning Models: `scikit-learn`

## Project Outcomes

- **Customer Preferences**: Gained insights into factors like cuisine types, average cost, and customer ratings that drive dining choices.
  
- **Restaurant Success Factors**: Identified key attributes that contribute to restaurant ratings, such as location, type of cuisine, and service quality.

- **Predictive Model**: Built an accurate classification model to predict whether a restaurant is expensive based on its features.


## Conclusion

The **Zomato Data Analysis** project provided valuable insights into online food-ordering behaviors, customer preferences, and restaurant success factors in India. The predictive models built as part of the project demonstrated strong accuracy in predicting restaurant cost, helping to inform strategic decision-making for restaurant owners.
